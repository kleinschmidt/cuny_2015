* Lead in with specific question : are labels used?
    * Example of labels
* [x] Behavior on labeled trials
* [x] Simpler summary figure (barplot)
* [x] Label labeled trials as b/p in historams
* [x] bigger plots!
    
* Spiel:
    * Okay, first question, do they use the labels at all?  Yes, 98% accurate.
    * Second question, do they use the labels for _learning_?  To see this, look at what they respond on the _unabeled_ trias

* Feedback on final draft
    * Overall: 
        * People found it hard to follow without explanation.  Not enough exposition/explanation
    * Introduction
        * [x] "why" box needs connectives (could also just be eliminated?)
        * [x] Elika hated "why?" and "what?"
    * Clarify design figures
        * [x] add "responded by clicking on picture.  available response options either:"
        * [x] arrows connecting neighboring distributional learning bits
        * terminology of "labeled/unlabeled" kind of confuses people.  Maybe "disambiguated"
    * Results figures
        * [-] add end caps to error bars?  MEH
        * [-] need legends?
    * Experiments
        * explain what's different in each experiment
        * [x] 'unsupervised/supervised' text could be bigger in 2+3
        * [x] add little explanations for discussion points, or move into figures
